\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

By approximately 400,000 years into its life, the universe had expanded (and cooled) sufficiently to allow the naked protons created in the Big Bang to capture electrons and form neutral atoms (mostly hydrogen). As the universe continued to expand and cool, clumps of gas began to accumulate in dark matter halos, eventually giving birth to the first (Population I) stars (z $\sim$ 20-30) and later still the first galaxies (z $\sim$ 10) \cite{Bromm}. High energy photons, generally from massive main sequence stars, supernovae, and quasars, began filling the universe and, as they encountered neutral atoms, stripped away their electrons, (re)ionizing them. By z $\sim$ 7, the IGM is almost fully ionized (though there remain scattered clouds of neutral gas) \cite{Stark}.\\

While it is clear that reionization requires copious numbers of ionizing photons, and those photons are produced by O and B stars, supernovae, and quasars it is unclear to what degree each of these mechanisms contribute such photons to the IGM. Quasars are fantastically bright (across the electromagnetic spectrum) and they are certainly active during reionization, but they are likely too few in number to dominate the ionizing photon budget \cite{Bromm}. Supernovae too are extremely bright, but while more numerous than quasars, are extremely transient and, though they may turn out to aid in the escape of UV photons from the galaxies, they cannot be a principle contributor to reionization. So, unless we turn to more speculative physics (self-interacting dark matter, cosmic strings, mini-quasars, etc), we are left with O/B stars as the primary driver of reionization, but there is a problem.\\

Certainly, star forming galaxies internally produce more than enough ionizing photons to fully account for IGM reionization, but, to succinctly state the problem, the fraction of UV photons that (on average) escape the host galaxies ($f^{UV}_{esc}$ or just $f_{esc}$ hereafter) into the IGM is extremely model dependent and effectively unconstrained. The predicted escape fraction depends (sometimes very sensitively) on a myriad of parameters (some poorly constrained) including the host galaxy's mass, dust content (and related mean metallicity), and neutral hydrogen column density and covering fraction. These individual predictions vary wildly from well less than 1\% to nearly 100\% \cite{Zackrisson} though the mean is probably on the lower end. For galaxies, essentially alone, to reionize the universe by z $\sim$ 7, most of the photons would have to come from smaller, fainter galaxies and the faint-end slope of the luminosity function would need to continue down to $M_{UV} \approx -13$ with $f_{esc} \approx 0.13 - 0.20$. If the faint-end slope flattens before then, $f_{esc}$ would need to be greater. Current observations reveal no turn-over down to $M_{UV} \approx -17$ with limited statistics suggesting the slope \textit{might} continue to steepen down to $M_{UV} \approx -14$ \cite{Livermore}. What ever the case, we must combine this with knowledge of the UV escape fraction if we are to have any real hope of understanding the mechanisms of reionization.\\

Ideally, we would resolve this issue by directly measuring $f_{esc}$, but as we push to higher redshifts, photons with wavelengths shorter than Ly$\alpha$ (1216$\AA$) and especially the hard ionizing photons we wish to measure (short-ward of the Lyman Limit (912 $\AA$)) are seriously attenuated by clouds of neutral hydrogen along our line of sight such that, in the most optimistic case, by z=4 (well short of our target of $7 < z < 9$) the signal is gone. Though it would be impossible to directly measure $f_{esc}$, all hope is not lost if it is possible to accurately estimate $f_{esc}$ from other measurements that can actually be made.\\

\section{Observations} \label{sec:obs}

TBD basics on observations (dates, sky regions, num fibers, etc)

\section{Data Reduction} \label{sec:reduction}

TBD basic data reduction ... reference instead a HETDEX paper?

{ \color{red} todo: Section or Subsection on key ELiXer features (PLAE/POII, catalog integration, aperture magnitudes) ?}

\section{Data Selection} \label{sec:selection}

TBD criteria imposed on selected observations and why. End with final observation/fiber counts.

As described early, it is absolutely critical that the data sample is free of mis-identifications and (especially insidious) faint continuum interlopers along the line of sight. Strict selection criteria were applied (described below), but, because the more automated classification processes are still being developed each potential detection was manually inspected before being included or rejected from the data set. As such, the selection criteria were set not only to isolate a clean sample, but also to keep the number of detections manageable for the bottleneck of manual examination. Certainly most valid LAEs were left "on the table" due to these highly limiting (but necessary) restrictions. 

The initial sample selection sought to eliminate obvious contaminants, spurious detections, and undesirable LAEs (specifically, AGN).

todo: go through each selection and provide pre/post selection counts and justification for the value used

The first step in reducing the potential LAE candidates from the set of all candidate detections in HDR1 was a simple threshold filter over several criteria. 

\subsection{Emission Wavelength}
Perhaps the easiest selection criteria to impose was the emission wavelength cut. Since we were interested in Lyman Continuum (880-910$\AA$) and the HETDEX observable wavelength range is 3470-5520 $\AA$, the minimum observed emission line wavelength was selected as 4860 $\AA$ (or z $\approx$ 3 for Ly$\alpha$) so that the blue end of our targeted Lyman Continuum range will be captured by the VIRUS spectrographs allowing for some small variation in each detector's wavelength range and avoid the edgemost pixels.

\subsection{Signal to Noise Ratio}
{ \color{red} todo: our definitions of SNR and why 6.5 was seleced }

\subsection{$\chi ^{2}$ Model Fit}

\subsection{Continuum Level}
{ \color{red} todo: limit continuum to reduce selection of AGN}

\subsection{Emission Line Width}

\subsection{Emission Line Flux}

\subsection{Photometric Imaging}


\subsection{Neighborhood}
In an effort to eliminate source confusion (even if all nearby sources are likely LAEs (potentially interacting) and the inclusion of light from other (bright and/or spatially extended) sources, we next examined the (on-sky) projected neighborhood around each target and reject any detections that have one or more 'bad neighbors'. We first eliminated any (point source like) detection with a neighboring source brighter than 26th magnitude within 5", then reduce the magnitude and the separations, rejecting detections with neighbors fainter than 26 inside 4", fainter than 27 inside 3" and fainter than 28 inside 2". 

Lastly, the remaining set of detections were each manually examined, checking extended photometric cutout regions (out to 30" in radius) to remove any detections that were potentially in the halo or outer regions of a spatially extended source (see the Manual Examination Subsection).


\subsection{Sky Fibers}
In order to assert a positive detection above sky noise, it was necessary to identify and average over a large number of "blank" sky fibers. The initial sample of sky fibers was taken as the set of all fibers that shared a VIRUS Amplifier (for the same exposure) with one or more of the fibers included in a detection. That sample was then reduced to include only those fibers that did not exhibit obvious continuum or emission by removing from the set any fiber with one or more 2$\AA$ wide bins with flux exceeding $3.0\times 10^{-17} erg\ s^{-1}\ cm^{-2}$ or one or more 500$\AA$ wide bins with mean flux outside $\pm 1.0 \times 10^{-17} erg\ s^{-1}\ cm^{-2}$.    { \color{red} todo: how many total sky fibers included, (less useful) what fraction were removed?}
 
\subsection{Edge Fibers}
If too much of a detections light falls off the edge of an IFU, it becomes difficult or impossible to correctly model the astrometric solution and obtain a proper determination of the flux (accounting for lost light, etc). Of particular issue for this work is the loss of shorter-wavelength light due to DAR (which would fall off the edge of the detector). Without an accurate position, we cannot match the detection to the correct counterpart in a photometric catalog and without a correct spectra we cannot apply the various selection criteria or make a justifiably accurate classification. While it may be possible to correct these issues for specific observations depending on the orientation of the instrument and how much light and position information is lost, for the limited purpose and scope of this paper, any detection whose most central (highest weighted) lay on the edge of its IFU was removed from consideration.  { \color{red} todo: detections removed or fraction of detections removed}

\subsection{Manual Examination}
The final step in vetting the sample was a manual examination of the ELiXer detection report in which the 2D fiber cutouts, pixel flats, CCD region, 1D spectra fit, full 1D spectra and photometric images were reviewed for any disqualifying conditions. 
{ \color{red} todo: enumerate and examples: like interference pattern, bad pixel flats, not completely handled cosmic rays, stuck pixel or charge trap, scattered light, large (spatially extended source) }


\section{Analysis and Results} \label{sec:analysis}

TBD description of analysis (shifting, stacking, etc) use of biweight vs mean vs median

{ \color{red} todo: progression of averaged spectra plots with increasing restriction on sample, show LyC fall off, etc .. over plot Steidel}


\section{Discussion and Future Work} \label{sec:discussion}
TBD brief discussion and future todos
{ \color{red} todo: discussion point, this is early data and classification is primitive ... HDR1 to inform and shape automated classification (machine learning, Bayesian ratio thresholds,etc) ... we do not know the probable fraction of contamination, etc; improvements to sky subtraction (can be wiping out true continuum), but is pretty good for local (to amp) sky}

{ \color{red} todo: discussion point, may have to manually inspect each detection ... mechanical turk?}

{ \color{red} todo: discussion point, LyA strength (EW) alone is not a good predictor of LyC as LyA is a complex function of physics and geometry there may even be an anti-correlation of LyC with LyA SN? If LyA strong could mean lots of neutral H and self shielding so little LyC escape ... but low sn, little hydrogen so little LyA produced but less shielding and relatively more LyC escapes?  So, for LyC detection might want lots of low sn and low EW LyA
Right now that's hard since need to manually examine all }

Potential contamination excluded (misidentification of emission line and faint continuum LOS interlopers), noise is the main limiting factor in our Lyman Continuum measurement. Future enhancements to the HETDEX pipeline should help address this issue by providing more readied access to larger LAE samples with both improved SNR and a lower viable SNR limit.

Todo: sky subtraction, machine learning, Bayesian ratio thresholds, additional imagaing catalogs with uniform magnitude corrections,
